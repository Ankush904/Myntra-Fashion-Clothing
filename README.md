###### ***The Myntra have shared the dataset with you to identify the attributes to increase sales. You are working as Lead consultant and your key role is to identify the parameters that are extremely important while making a decision.
As a lead consultant you also have to show the results to your client and managers so itâ€™s advised to create charts while you perform analysis and write down the insights in some separate sheet that you can refer later on.
Some of the problems can be easily identified while solving the scenarios and tasks shared here but you are also required to further share your key points in the Conclusion.
